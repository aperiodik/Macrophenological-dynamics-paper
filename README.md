# Code and data to reproduce the analysis in "Macrophenological dynamics from citizen science plant occurrence data".

#### Publication:
The folder contains the data and R code to reproduce the analysis and plots presented in the manuscript: \
**"Macrophenological dynamics from citizen science plant occurrence data"** \
**Authors**: Karin Mora, Michael Rzanny, Jana Wäldchen, Hannes Feilhauer, Teja Kattenborn, Guido Kraemer, Patrick Mäder, Daria Svidzinska, Sophie Wolf, and Miguel D. Mahecha \
**Methods in Ecology and Evolution**
**doi:**


#### To run the code:
Data: Before you run the code, the data file (mydata.zip) has to be unzipped. Note, that the data has been split zipped into two files (mydata.zip and mydata.z01 have to be in the same folder).


#### Aside
This code builds on the code by
Mahecha, Miguel D., et al. "Crowd‐sourced plant occurrence data provide a reliable description of macroecological gradients." Ecography 44.8 (2021): 1131-1142.
